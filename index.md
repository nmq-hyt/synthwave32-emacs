An emacs color theme, based on the popular VScode synthwave84 color scheme. Originally based on <https://github.com/artanikin/vim-synthwave84>, artanikin's vim port of said color scheme.

## Screenshots

## Installation (manual)
Extract the file to your 'custom-theme-load-path', which is accessible through emacs through the variable of the same name.
Extracting to your ~/.emacs.d/ folder should be good for Linux-based systems.

For more info, please see the offical manual's relevant pages:
* (Linux) https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Custom-Themes.html
* (Windows) www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/efaq-w32.html

# Misc
I intend to eventually submit the code to MELPA, but need to do further work (e.g., linting, checkdoc) beforehand.
Until such a time, the only way to install this theme is manuall, as above
